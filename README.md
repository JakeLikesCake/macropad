This project is in no way designed to be used from mechandies and is an open source project. 
There are some shortcomings in the PCBs design but nothing a simple flush cutter couldn't fix. All the SMD components are package size 0805. Required are 7 SMD resistors (330 Ohms), 1MOhms SMD resistor, 270Ohms SMD resistor, one AO3416A Transistor and a tactile button similar to this (https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Tactile-Switches_Diptronics-DTSMW-66N-V-T-R_C224987.html) one. 
Exept for that you will need a pro micro, LEDs and 7 cherry style switches as well as two rotary encoders.
